<p>The increasingly concurrent and parallel landscape of hardware and software infrastructures demands the exploration and understanding of a wide variety of foundational and practical ideas. The International Workshop on Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software (PLACES) is dedicated to work in this area. The workshop offers a forum for researchers from different fields to exchange new ideas about these challenges to modern and future programming, where concurrency and distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern. The topic is central and combines well with the main conferences of ETAPS, in particular with ESOP. PLACES has been a satellite workshop of ETAPS since 2009, and is now well established as an ETAPS event. It is usually one of the larger ETAPS workshops in terms of attendance.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333">PLACES has had 11 previous iterations, most of which co-located with ETAPS; this will be the twelfth edition.</span></p>
