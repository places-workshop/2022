The increasingly concurrent and parallel landscape of hardware and software infrastructures demands the exploration and understanding of a wide variety of foundational and practical ideas. **The International Workshop on Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software (PLACES)** is dedicated to work in this area. The workshop offers a forum for researchers from different fields to exchange new ideas about these challenges to modern and future programming, where concurrency and distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern.  

**Submissions** 

Submissions are invited in the general area of programming language approaches to concurrency, communication and distribution, ranging from foundational issues, through language implementations, to applications and case studies. Submissions are peer-reviewed by a minimum of three reviewers, with the aim of allocating at least one expert reviewer. Papers are reviewed based on their **novelty**, **clarity**, and **technical soundness**. Submissions must not be submitted for publication elsewhere and must be formatted in [**EPTCS format**](http://style.eptcs.org/). 

We accept the following submissions: 
* Full Research papers containing a maximum of 8 pages (with no restriction on bibliography or appendices, which the reviewers need not read). Full research papers will appear in the workshop proceedings
* **(NEW)** Extended abstracts containing a maximum of 2 pages (with no restriction on bibliography or appendices, which the reviewers need not read). Accepted extended abstracts will be presented at the workshop, but will not appear in the workshop proceedings. 

The proceedings of PLACES 2022 will be published as a volume of EPTCS.

**Topics**

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
* Design and implementation of programming languages with first class concurrency and communication primitives

* Behavioural types, including session types
* Concurrent data types, objects and actors
* Verification and program analysis methods for safe and secure concurrent and distributed software 
* Interface and contract languages for communication and distribution
* Applications to microservices, sensor networks, scientific computing, HPC, blockchains, robotics
* Concurrency and communication in event processing and business process management

**Important dates**
