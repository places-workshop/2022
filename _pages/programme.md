**Welcome**

[8:55] Welcome & Introduction (by M. Carbone and R. Neykova)


**Invited Talk (chair: Marco Carbone)**

[9:00] Ilya Sergey. _Growing a Smart Contract Language for a High-Throughput Blockchain_
```{toggle} Abstract Here
:show:
The Scilla project, aimed at creating a programming language for safe and secure smart contracts, has started in late 2017 as a 100-lines-of-code prototype implemented in the Coq proof assistant. Learning from the mistakes of Ethereum, which had pioneered the area of blockchain-based smart contracts, the aim of Scilla was to provide a smart contract language, which is expressive enough to accommodate most of the reasonable use-cases, while allowing for scalable and tractable formal verification and analysis.
 
Since 2019, Scilla has been powering the application layer of Zilliqa, the world's first publicly deployed sharded blockchain system. Since its public launch, hundreds of unique smart contracts implemented in Scilla have been deployed, including custom tokens, collectibles (NFTs), auctions, multiplayer games, name registries, atomic token swaps, and many others. The design of Scilla has enabled the very first approach for efficiently sharding account-based smart contracts in a Layer-1 scalable blockchain protocol.
 
In my talk, I will describe the motivation, high-level design principles, and semantics of Scilla, and outline the main use cases and the tools provided by the developer community. I will also present a framework for lightweight verification of Scilla programs, and showcase its automated domain-specific analyses, aiming at proving different notions of safety and enabling sharding-based parallelism. Finally, I will outline the pragmatic pitfalls of building a new smart contract language from scratch, and present the future exciting research directions that are enabled by Scilla's take on smart contract implementation.
